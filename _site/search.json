    "text": "In the sport of Hockey there are a multitude of different factors that drastically change the outcome of a shot. The goal of this overview was to analyze Hockey shots/goals to understand the impact of the various factors surrounding them such as the position the player plays or what type of shot they took. I pulled data containing the 2010-2018 regular seasons from Kaggle and manipulated it to be able to better show the effect of these factors on the outcome of a shot. After seeing these graphs I hope that it will be able to better demonstrate how different factors can have a major impact on the outcome of each shot."
